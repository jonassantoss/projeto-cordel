# projeto-cordel

This project is a website about cordel that uses CSS resources to improve the user experience. Among the features are parallax effect, responsive texts, and control of background images.

Resources
Parallax Effect
The parallax effect is a technique that creates the illusion of depth on a website. It is created by moving elements of different layers at different speeds during the user's scroll on the page. This creates the sensation that the elements are at different distances from each other, giving depth to the page.

Responsive Texts
Responsive text is a technique that allows text to adapt to the size of the device screen. This is important because people use devices of different sizes to browse the internet. Responsive text ensures that the text is legible on any device.

Control of Background Images
Background images are important on a website because they can help define the atmosphere and style of the site. However, if the images are too large, they can slow down the site. The control of background images allows the developer to adjust the size and resolution of the background image to ensure that it does not harm the site's performance.
